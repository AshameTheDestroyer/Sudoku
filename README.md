# Sudoku

A small game, (not really, it's a lie, it's a massive freaking game), made to entertain your brain, it was a also inspired by the same person that gave me the previous repository idea 🔥.

This was actually a quite tough challenge to achieve and get done quickly, with over +1000 lines of JS code , +800 CSS code, and +200 HTML code, I was finished.

In this project I made lots of achievemnts, such as: algorithms, problem solving, new CSS properties for me, responsiveness, documentating, and more, was such a wonderful experience 👩🏻‍💻.
